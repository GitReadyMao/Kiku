        <h2>Welcome,</h2>
        <p>
            Katakana (片仮名、カタカナ, IPA: [katakaꜜna, kataꜜkana]) is a Japanese syllabary, 
            one component of the Japanese writing system along with hiragana,[2] kanji and in some cases the Latin script (known as rōmaji).
        </p>

        <p>
            The word katakana means "fragmentary kana", as the katakana characters are derived from components or fragments of more complex kanji. 
            Katakana and hiragana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each syllable (strictly mora) in the Japanese language 
            is represented by one character or kana in each system.
        </p>

        <h2>Hiragana,</h3>
        <p>
            Hiragana (平仮名, ひらがな, IPA: [çiɾaɡaꜜna, çiɾaɡana(ꜜ)]) is a Japanese syllabary, part of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana as well as kanji.
            It is a phonetic lettering system. The word hiragana means "common" or "plain" kana (originally also "easy", as contrasted with kanji).[1][2][3]
        </p>

        <div class="image-container clearfix">
            <img src="Pngs/ex.png" alt="example" class="image-right" width="412" height="223">
            <p>
                Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With few exceptions, each mora in the Japanese language is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. 
                This may be a vowel such as /a/ (hiragana あ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as /ka/ (か); or /N/ (ん), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context and dialect,
                 sounds either like English m, n or ng ([ŋ]) when syllable-final or like the nasal vowels of French, Portuguese or Polish.
            
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Casual / Ranking System</h4>
        <p>
            Hiragana and katakana are two different ways to write the same set of 46 sounds. They’re the closest the Japanese language has to an alphabet. The primary difference between this kind of writing system 
            – technically a 'syllabary' – and an 'alphabet'? Characters generally represent a whole sound (like ‘ki’ or ‘ra’), rather than individual letters (like ‘k’ or ‘r’).
        </p>
        <p>
            Usually, we write native Japanese words using hiragana, while katakana is used for words borrowed from other languages. So, for example, arigatou, Japanese for “thank you”, is typically written ありがとう 
            (a ri ga to u) using hiragana characters, whereas “America” is written アメリカ (a me ri ka) using katakana.
